# Octsock5_cSharp - high speed inter-process data interface #

C# counterpart to Julia octsock5 at https://github.com/mnentwig/octsock5.jl

The main documentation can be found there.

The C# project includes the octsock5 library and a standalone loopback client that echoes all received data back.

```julia Pkg.test("octsock5") ``` from Julia will exercise all test cases.

## Performance on reference system ## 

Throughput: e.g. 928 MBytes / second on reference system (roundtrip)

latency: e.g. 30 microseconds for a single scalar (roundtrip)
