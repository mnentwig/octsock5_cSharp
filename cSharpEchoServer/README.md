# Octsock5_cSharp - high speed inter-process data interface #

C# counterpart to Julia octsock5 at https://github.com/mnentwig/octsock5.jl

The included standalone program acts as loopback client that echoes all received data back. Instructions for testing with the Julia end are shown on-screen.


## Performance on reference system ## 

Throughput: e.g. 928 MBytes / second on reference system (roundtrip)

latency: e.g. 30 microseconds for a single scalar (roundtrip)
